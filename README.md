Hey!
My name is Jace Rogers and this is just a little snippet about me.
I'm a student for BloomTech and learning full stack web development and JavaScript.

Yada, yada, yada. So what?

Well, to be honest, it's really intense. I often feel in over my head.
What I'm learning feels revolutionary and I'm amazed at all the things I still have yet to learn.
But the interesting thing is- if I look back, even to just a few months ago, I've come so far and learned so much.
I'm caught in a fascinating paradox:
I feel like I know all that I need to know,
but whenever I learn something new, I realize just how much more there is to learn.
Last of all, I only realize exactly how much I've learned when I reflect on when I thought I knew it all.
Learning so many new things has definitely been a humbling experience.

Anyway, there's a few of my thoughts.
I may have a few more but I'll hang on to those for now.

Take care!
