Hey!
My name is Jace Rogers and this is just a little snippet about me.
I'm a student for BloomTech and learning full stack web development and JavaScript.

Yada, yada, yada. So what?

Well, to be honest it's pretty crazy. I feel way in over my head and frequently overwhelmed.
I am learning a ton of new things and I feel like an idiot all the time.
But the crazy thing is- if I look back to who I was and what I knew a few months ago, everything has changed (especially me) so much.
I'm caught in a fascinating paradox:
I feel like I know all I need to know,
but when I learn something new, I realize I know so little.
Last of all, I only realize exactly how much I've learned if I look backwards.
Though learning may make one wiser, it sure can make him feel stupid.
My world is a new place. Think I'm exaggerating? I might be. But only a little.

Anyway, there's my two cents.
I may have a few more but I don't think I'll put them in this piggy bank.

Take care!
